CNVScope v2.9.2 (Release Date 2019-12-5)
==============
*Added an explicit dependency, Biostrings to keep CRAN check errors on debian from occurring.
*Made a small fix to rebinGenomicInteractions, fixing a check at the end to handle a vector input
**This will make the package compatible with R 4.0.

CNVScope v2.8.2 (Release Date 2019-10-23)
==============
*Removed all blockseg references in code. It was a nice feature to have a third algorithm, but blockseg will not be on CRAN shortly.

CNVScope v2.8.1 (Release Date 2019-10-23)
==============
*Removed blockseg as a strong dependency, per CRAN.


CNVScope v2.7.7 (Release Date 2019-10-18)
==============
*Updated documentation (some new images have been added to show the effect of bin sizes and resolution).
*Fixed a broken URL that was causing a CRAN note.

CNVScope v2.7.5 (Release Date 2019-10-12)
==============
*Updated documentation for finely binned matrices (see the input matrix vignette).
*Several sizes of NBL whole genome matrices are available within the package (1e5,2.5e5,1e6,1e7,1e8).
**These are for package use only. The HD matrices are not speed-optimal for app use.
**Functionality of basic package functions remains the same as 2.7.2.5.
*passes CRAN checks again with flying colors (no notes, warnings, or errors).

CNVScope v2.7.2.5 (Release Date 2019-09-21)
==============
*Added P-value filter
*Added correlatoin options
*Added additional app visualization options.
*Added material on how to make higher resolution maps.

CNVScope v2.5.4 (Release date: 2019-07-19)
==============
*Minor changes to package dependency CNVScopePublicData.

CNVScope v2.5.2 (Release date: 2019-07-18)
==============
*Another minor cran fix to CNVScopeserver.

CNVScope v2.5.1 (Release date: 2019-07-18)
==============
*Small changes to CNVScopeserver to fix a CRAN check.

CNVScope v2.5.0 (Release date: 2019-07-18)
==============
*Small changes in 2.4.9 to the README, for publicity.
*Major changes to many functions to pass CRAN checks (global variable issues).
CNVScope v2.4.8 (Release date: 2019-07-17)
==============
*Small changes to dependencies (including pwr package) and vignettes.

CNVScope v2.4.7 (Release date: 2019-07-16)
==============
*Minor fix to freadGDCfile documentation

CNVScope v2.4.6 (Release date: 2019-07-15)
==============
*More information about BLCA, SKCM, and AML in additional examples vignette
**Their processed files have been placed within the package
**These are available only on the github site as the CRAN size limitations forbid it.
*Added the ability to specify chrM and chrY in formSampleMatrixFromRawGDCData function.

CNVScope v2.4.4 (Release date: 2019-07-09)
==============

Changes:
* Fixed vignettes not properly linking to the package.
CNVScope v2.4.4 (Release date: 2019-07-09)
==============

Changes:

* Added a power analysis vignette
* Fixed issues with formSampleMatrixFromRawGDCData
** These issues arose from changing types with underlying Bioconductor dependencies from character to factor Rle.
* Updated the build for R-base v3.6.1
*prior to this, this package now works with CNVScopePublicData, a large package containing
*all that is requisite to run the server locally.
