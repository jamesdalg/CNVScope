```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = '.')
library(CNVScope)
```
We have to begin our work by loading the library:
```{r,eval=F,echo=T}
library(CNVScope)
```
Following this, we'll obtain TARGET low-pass neuroblastoma data (NBL) from the GDC archive.
Please note: TARGET_NBL_WGS_CNVLOH.tsv is a clinical metadata file and therefore not compatible with the ensuing functions to extract segment data.
We have also chosen to use only a single comparison type (NormalVsPrimary) to ensure comparability and compatibility with the data. Users can download the tar.gz file and remove the tsv files into a single folder. We have already done that here.
The source for these files is located [here](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/legacy-archive/search/f?filters=%7B%22op%22:%22and%22,%22content%22:%5B%7B%22op%22:%22in%22,%22content%22:%7B%22field%22:%22files.data_category%22,%22value%22:%5B%22Copy%20number%20variation%22%5D%7D%7D,%7B%22op%22:%22in%22,%22content%22:%7B%22field%22:%22files.experimental_strategy%22,%22value%22:%5B%22WGS%22%5D%7D%7D,%7B%22op%22:%22in%22,%22content%22:%7B%22field%22:%22files.access%22,%22value%22:%5B%22open%22%5D%7D%7D,%7B%22op%22:%22in%22,%22content%22:%7B%22field%22:%22cases.project.project_id%22,%22value%22:%5B%22TARGET-NBL%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D&pagination=%7B%22files%22:%7B%22from%22:101,%22size%22:100,%22sort%22:%22cases.project.project_id:asc%22%7D%7D)

The user simply chooses to add all the files to the cart, then click the black cart button in the top right hand corner.
![](download_from_cart.png)


On the cart page, click download, then cart. It will be downloaded as a tar.gz archive.

You can untar it with R, but the files will be in a complex set of directories. It is best to list the files recursively
with criteria that will obtain the segment files in tsv format, with that single comparison of interest.
```{r nbl_files,eval=F,echo=T}
if(!dir.exists("extracted_nbl_data")){dir.create("extracted_nbl_data")}
untar("gdc_download_20180801_160142.tar.gz",exdir = "extracted_nbl_data")
target_files_nbl<-list.files(path = "extracted_nbl_data",pattern=glob2rx("*NormalVsPrimary.tsv"),recursive=T,full.names = T)
print(target_files_nbl)

```
With the full list of input files from the GDC, these can then be simply loaded into a function that will read all of them, sample match them, and aggregate the data into a bin-sample matrix. This matrix can then be saved into the fast, space efficient, RDS filetype.
```{r,eval=F,echo=T}
sample_aggregated_segvals_output_full<-formSampleMatrixFromRawGDCData(tcga_files = target_files_nbl,format = "TARGET")
saveRDS(sample_aggregated_segvals_output_full,"NBL_sample_matched_input_matrix.rds")

```

With this, your input matrix is complete. Next, please look at the [vignette that details recursive linear regression and postprocessing](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CNVScope/vignettes/create_output_matrix.html).

There are fewer TARGET datasets available than TCGA. We'll do AML first. We've named our downloaded archive gdc_download_aml.tar.gz.

```{r aml_files,eval=F,echo=T}
if(!dir.exists("extracted_aml_data")){dir.create("extracted_aml_data")}
untar("gdc_download_aml.tar.gz",exdir = "./extracted_aml_data")
target_files_aml<-list.files(path = "extracted_aml_data",pattern=glob2rx("*NormalVsPrimary.tsv"),recursive=T,full.names = T)
print(target_files_aml)
```

```{r,eval=F,echo=T}
sample_aggregated_segvals_aml<-formSampleMatrixFromRawGDCData(tcga_files = target_files_aml,format = "TARGET")
saveRDS(sample_aggregated_segvals_aml,"aml_sample_matched_input_matrix.rds")
```

Now that we've created and saved the AML matrix, let's visualize it with a quick correlation map of a single chromosome, chromosome 13, the location of the FLT3 gene. The FLT3 gene is a locus for recurrent copy number aberrations(reference: http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/130/Suppl_1/3800?sso-checked=true).
```{r aml_plots, eval=F,echo=T}
cor(t(sample_aggregated_segvals_aml))  %>% 
  CNVScope::signedRescale(max_cap=75) %>%
  reshape2::melt()  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Var1,y=Var2,fill=value)) + geom_raster() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),axis.text.y=element_blank()) +
  ggplot2::scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", high = "red", midpoint = 0.5, limits = c(0, 1))
```

Now for a TCGA set, let's try a bladder cancer dataset:
```{r aml_files,eval=F,echo=T}
if(!dir.exists("extracted_blca_data")){dir.create("extracted_blca_data")}
untar("gdc_download_blca.tar.gz",exdir = "./extracted_blca_data")
tcga_files_blca<-list.files(path = "extracted_blca_data",pattern=glob2rx("*.tsv"),recursive=T,full.names = T)
print(tcga_files_blca)
```
