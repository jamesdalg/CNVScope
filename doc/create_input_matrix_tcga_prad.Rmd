```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = '.')
library(CNVScope)
```
We have to begin our work by loading the library:
```{r,eval=F,echo=T}
library(CNVScope)
```
Following this, we'll obtain TCGA copy number data from the GDC archive.

 Users can download the tar.gz file and remove the tsv files into a single folder. We have already done that here.
The source for these files is located [here](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/legacy-archive/search/f?filters=%7B%22op%22:%22and%22,%22content%22:%5B%7B%22op%22:%22in%22,%22content%22:%7B%22field%22:%22files.data_category%22,%22value%22:%5B%22Copy%20number%20variation%22%5D%7D%7D,%7B%22op%22:%22in%22,%22content%22:%7B%22field%22:%22files.experimental_strategy%22,%22value%22:%5B%22WGS%22%5D%7D%7D,%7B%22op%22:%22in%22,%22content%22:%7B%22field%22:%22files.access%22,%22value%22:%5B%22open%22%5D%7D%7D,%7B%22op%22:%22in%22,%22content%22:%7B%22field%22:%22cases.project.project_id%22,%22value%22:%5B%22TCGA-PRAD%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D&pagination=%7B%22files%22:%7B%22from%22:0,%22size%22:100,%22sort%22:%22cases.project.project_id:asc%22%7D%7D)
![](prad_files.png){width=250px}

The user simply chooses to add all the files to the cart, then click the black cart button in the top right hand corner.
![](download_from_cart_prad.png){width=250px}


On the cart page, click download, then cart. It will be downloaded as a tar.gz archive.

You can untar it with R, but the files will be in a complex set of directories. It is best to list the files recursively
with criteria that will obtain the segment files in tsv format, with that single comparison of interest.
```{r,eval=F,echo=T}
if(!dir.exists("extracted_prad_data")){dir.create("extracted_prad_data")
untar("gdc_download_prad.tar.gz",exdir = "extracted_prad_data")}
tcga_files_prad<-list.files(path = "extracted_prad_data",pattern=glob2rx("*.tsv"),recursive=T,full.names = T)
print(tcga_files_prad)

```
With the full list of input files from the GDC, these can then be simply loaded into a function that will read all of them, sample match them, and aggregate the data into a bin-sample matrix. This matrix can then be saved into the fast, space efficient, RDS filetype.
```{r,eval=F,echo=T}
sample_aggregated_segvals_output_full_prad<-formSampleMatrixFromRawGDCData(tcga_files = tcga_files_prad,format = "TCGA",binsize=1e6)
saveRDS(sample_aggregated_segvals_output_full_prad,"PRAD_sample_matched_input_matrix.rds")

```
